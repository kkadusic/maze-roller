# MazeRoller

MazeRoller is a Roll-a-Ball game made in [Unity 3D](https://unity.com/). It consists of three different levels with three different environments. The main goal is to get out of the maze. Each subsequent level is more difficult than the previous one. To complete the first level it is also necessary to collect five items. There are also enemy balls in the game that make the game more challenging. The game can be paused at any time and resumed later.
